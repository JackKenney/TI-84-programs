# TI-84 Calculator Programs

## Translated to TXT, Source files (.8Xp) kept.

Included is a python file to convert all .8Xp files in this directory to .txt files and store the source files in the '8Xp' directory and the text files in the 'txt' directory.

### Prerequisites + Installing

To run the python script you will need to install python3, python3-pip, setuptools module, and the os module

Note: *these are instruction for a linux machine*

```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install setuptools os
```

Then, to install basically-ti-basic follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/thenaterhood/basically-ti-basic).

## Running the converter

Simply populate the directory that contains convert.py with the '.8Xp' files you would like to convert to text, and run

```
python3 convert.py
```

And you're done! All .txt files should be in the 'txt' folder and original .8Xp files in the '8Xp' folder
